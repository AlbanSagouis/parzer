This is a new release. I have read and agree to the the
CRAN policies at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

This is a re-submission of the first version of this package, removing 
commented out examples (all examples runs now), and fixing authors in DESCRIPTION file.

Thanks!
Scott Chamberlain
